//        You have to represent _brudnopis.a.a point in 2D space. Write _brudnopis.a.a class with the name Point. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name x and y of type int.
//        The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg constructor). The second constructor has parameters x and y of type int
//        and it needs to initialize the fields.
//        Write the following methods (instance methods):
//        * Method named getX without any parameters, it needs to return the value of x field.
//        * Method named getY without any parameters, it needs to return the value of y field.
//        * Method named setX with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the x field.
//        * Method named setY with one parameter of type int, it needs to set the value of the y field.
//        * Method named distance without any parameters, it needs to return the distance between this Point and Point 0,0 as double.
//        * Method named distance with two parameters x, y both of type int, it needs to return the distance between this Point and Point x,y as double.
//        * Method named distance with parameter another of type Point, it needs to return the distance between this Point and another Point as double.

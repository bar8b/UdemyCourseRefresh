//        Write a class with the name ComplexNumber. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name real and imaginary of type double. It represents the Complex Number.
//        The class needs to have one constructor. The constructor has parameters real and imaginary of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.
//        Write the following methods (instance methods):
//        * Method named getReal without any parameters, it needs to return the value of real field.
//        * Method named getImaginary without any parameters, it needs to return the value of imaginary field.
//        * Method named add with two parameters real and imaginary of type double, it needs to add parameters to fields. In other words,
//        needs to do a complex number add operation as described above.
//        * Method named add with one parameter of type ComplexNumber. It needs to add the ComplexNumber parameter to the corresponding instance variables.
//        * Method named subtract with two parameters real and imaginary of type double, it needs to subtract parameters from fields, in other words,
//        it needs to do a complex number subtract operation as described above.
//        * Method named subtract with one parameter other of type ComplexNumber. It needs to subtract the other parameter from this complex number.
